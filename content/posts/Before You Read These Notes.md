## Purpose and Limitations

These online notes are only lightly edited versions of my personal notes, so imperfections are inevitable. I've done my best to avoid factual errors, but can't guarantee much beyond that. Therefore, these notes are not a substitute for standard textbooks, and you (most likely) won't be able to rely on them for last-minute cramming if you've missed lots of lectures.

You might find them helpful if you:
* self-study and spend too much time comparing how different books explain the same concept;
* take a related course with poorly written or nonexistent lecture notes;
* feel that some sources give disproportionate attention to minor results that don't really matter;
* have a strong urge to punch the author every time a nontrivial or even difficult proof is skipped or left as an exercise.

On the other hand, you'll probably be disappointed if you:
* look to learn calculus, introductory linear algebra, or other more elementary topics;
* hope for engaging, well-motivated explanations in the style of a popular science book;
* expect a fully self-contained material.
## Prerequisites

It goes without saying that a solid foundation in high school-level mathematics is assumed. In addition, you should have completed the following coursework or mastered equivalent material:
* A full sequence of calculus courses, covering single-variable and multivariable calculus, with proficiency in standard computational techniques.
* A course in basic discrete mathematics, covering logic, set theory, functions and relations, mathematical induction, and very elementary number theory.
* A course in basic linear algebra, corresponding approximately to Chapters 1-6 of [*Linear Algebra Done Right*](https://linear.axler.net) by Axler, covering vector spaces, linear maps, matrix representations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the diagonalization context, and inner product spaces.
* A course in basic classical analysis. While it does not need to cover topics such as measure theory or Fourier analysis, it should be proof-based and primarily formulated using $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ arguments. A proper introduction to metric and Euclidean spaces, along with some early exposure to topological ideas, is expected. In short, the course should have a depth and breadth no less than that of [*Understanding Analysis*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-2712-8) by Abbott.
