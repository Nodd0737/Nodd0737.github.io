## Basis, subbasis, and neighborhood basis

> [!info] Basis
> Given a set $X$, a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a **basis** for a topology on $X$ if:
> - For every $x\in X$, there exists $B\in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B$.
> - If $x\in B_1\cap B_2$ for $B_1,B_2\in \mathcal{B}$, then there exists $B_3\in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B_3\subseteq B_1\cap B_2$.

The topology **generated by $\mathcal{B}$** consists of all unions of elements from $\mathcal{B}$.

**Proposition:**  
A set $U \subseteq X$ is open **iff** for every $x \in U$, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$.  

A subset $U \subseteq X$ is open in the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ if and only if for every $x \in U$, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$.


> [!info] Subbasis
> Given a set $X$, a collection $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a **subbasis** for a topology on $X$ if the finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ form a basis for the topology.

The topology **generated by $\mathcal{S}$** is the collection of all unions of finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$.

The generated topology is the smallest topology containing $\mathcal{S}$.  


> [!info] Neighborhood basis

Let $X$ be a topological space and $x\in X$. A collection $\mathcal{N}_x$ of open sets is called a **neighborhood basis** at $x$ if:
* Each $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$ contains $x$,
* For every open set $U \ni x$, there exists $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$ such that $N \subseteq U$.

**Proposition:**  
The topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all unions of finite intersections of $\mathcal{S}$-elements.  

A **neighborhood basis** at $x \in X$ is a family $\mathcal{N}_x$ of neighborhoods of $x$ such that every neighborhood of $x$ contains some $N \in \mathcal{N}_x$.  

**Key Example:**  
- The balls $B_{1/n}(x)$ form a neighborhood basis at $x$ in a metric space.  

**Proposition:**  
- If $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis, $\mathcal{B}_x = \{B \in \mathcal{B} \mid x \in B\}$ is a neighborhood basis at $x$.  
- A space is **first-countable** if every point has a countable neighborhood basis.  
### **Relations Summary**  
1. **Subbasis $\rightarrow$ Basis**: Take finite intersections.  
2. **Basis $\rightarrow$ Topology**: Take arbitrary unions.  
3. **Basis $\rightarrow$ Neighborhood Basis**: Restrict to sets containing $x$.  
## Initial and final topologies

> [!info] Initial topology
> Given a set $X$ and a family of topological spaces $\{Y_\alpha\}$, let $\{f_\alpha:X\to Y_\alpha\}$ be a family of maps. The **initial topology** on $X$ induced by $\{f_\alpha\}$ is the coarsest topology on $X$ that makes each $f_\alpha$ continuous.

> [!info] Final topology
> Given a set $Y$ and a family of topological spaces $\{X_\alpha\}$, let $\{f_\alpha:X_\alpha\to Y\}$ be a family of maps. The **final topology** on $Y$ induced by $\{f_\alpha\}$ is the finest topology on $Y$ that makes each $f_\alpha$ continuous.
