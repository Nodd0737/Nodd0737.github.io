> [!info] Regular value & Critical value
> Let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds. A point $q\in N$ is called a **regular value** of $f$ if for every $p\in f^{-1}(q)$, the differential $df_p:T_pM\to T_qN$ is surjective. A point $q\in N$ is called a **critical value** of $f$ if it is not a regular value.

> [!note] Preimage theorem
> Let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds. If $q\in N$ is a regular value of $f$, then the preimage $f^{-1}(q)$ is a smooth submanifold of $M$ of dimension  $\dim M-\dim N$.

> [!note] Sard's theorem
> Let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds. Then the set of critical values of $f$ has measure zero in $N$.
