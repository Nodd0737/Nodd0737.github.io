> [!info] Derivation on a manifold
> Given a smooth manifold $M$, a **derivation** at a point $p\in M$ is a linear map $D:C^\infty(M)\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the Leibniz rule: $D(fg)=f(p)D(g)+g(p)D(f)$ for all $f,g\in C^\infty(M)$.  

> [!info] Tangent space
> Given a smooth manifold $M$, the **tangent space** at a point $p\in M$, denoted by $T_pM$, is the vector space consisting of all derivations at $p$.

> [!info] Tangent bundle
> The **tangent bundle** of a smooth manifold $M$, denoted by $TM$, is the disjoint union of the tangent spaces at all points of $M$, that is, $\displaystyle TM=\bigsqcup_{p\in M} T_pM$.

> [!important] Each element of $TM$ is a pair $(p,v)$, where $p\in M$ and $v\in T_pM$. There is a natural projection $\pi:TM\to M$ given by $\pi(p,v)=p$.

> [!info] Differential of a smooth map
> Let $f:M\to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds. The differential of $f$ at a point $p\in M$ is the linear map $df_p:T_pM\to T_{f(p)}N$, defined by $(df_p(v))(g)=v(g\circ f)$ for all $v\in T_pM$ and $g\in C^\infty(N)$.

> [!danger] Remark
> In many sources, the differential of a smooth map is also referred to as theÂ **pushforward**.

If $M$ and $N$ are Euclidean spaces, the differential between them is the Jacobian matrix acting on tangent vectors.
